      <p>
        A personal blogger keeps a website which may include diary-like entries,
        photographs, and links to other sites. Such a blog is a record of how
        the blogger spends her days — vacations, weekend outings, books and
        movies she's watched, and so on. Fashion bloggers might take photos of
        outfits or link to shopping sites, and pop culture bloggers might recap
        last night's TV shows. Blogger comes from blog, first used in 1998 as
        shorthand for weblog.A blogger is someone who regularly writes and
        publishes content (known as blog posts) on a blog, a type of website or
        platform. Bloggers typically share their thoughts, expertise, or
        personal experiences on various topics such as travel, fashion,
        technology, food, fitness, personal development, and more. The content
        may include articles, photos, videos, and other media. Blogging can be
        done as a hobby, a form of self-expression, or as a profession where
        bloggers can earn income through advertising, sponsored posts, affiliate
        marketing, and other revenue streams. Famous bloggers often become
        influencers with a significant following, and they may collaborate with
        brands or companies based on their niche and audience.
